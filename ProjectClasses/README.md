Hexworlds is a WIP project. The project will be both a program capable of simulating a "hexcrawl" style campaign as well as being its own randomly generated world exploration game.

The fundamental idea is that a world will be generated in a hexogonal map, which will allow the world to be simply explored by a "party" of players. The idea is to automate and simulate as much as possible of a traditional campaign, complete with fights, encounters and mechanics. 

Dev Logs, Progress Update, Mechanics/Gameplay theorycrafting, Game Art, Worldbuilding/Lore and other material will be posted here (https://hexknight.blogspot.com/2024/03/dwarves-ymmiri-dwarves-ymrmmri-in_24.html).
